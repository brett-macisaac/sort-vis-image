note: when testing PWA capabilities (use Chrome, not Firefox), I've found that if the 'Update on reload' checkbox is 
checked, this can result in the page not loading when in offline mode.

TODO:
- Create a custom loading animation that is a small bar graph that gets constantly sorted and shuffled (or maybe a small mona lisa face that gets shuffled and sorted).
- Implement the direction change feature.
- Implement the inactive style for the upload image button.
- do a vite GitHub error report with private class variables. First check chrome version, vite version, etc. Make a separate repro.
